      "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is often taught at the academic level from the perspective of computational linguists. However, as data scientists, we have a richer view of the natural language world - unstructured data that by its very nature has latent information that is important to humans. NLP practioners have benefited from machine learning techniques to unlock meaning from large corpora, and in this class we\u2019ll explore how to do that particularly with Python and with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). \n",
      "\n",
      "NLTK is an excellent library for machine-learning based NLP, written in Python by experts from both academia and industry. Python allows you to create rich data applications rapidly, iterating on hypotheses. The combination of Python + NLTK means that you can easily add language-aware data products to your larger analytical workflows and applications. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Quick Overview of NLTK\n",
      "NLTK stands for the Natural Language Toolkit and is written by two eminent computational linguists, Steven Bird (Senior Research Associate of the LDC and professor at the University of Melbourne) and Ewan Klein (Professor of Linguistics at Edinburgh University). NTLK provides a combination of natural language corpora, lexical resources, and example grammars with language processing algorithms, methodologies and demonstrations for a very pythonic \"batteries included\" view of Natural Language Processing.   \n",
      "\n",
      "As such, NLTK is perfect for researh driven (hypothesis driven) workflows for agile data science. Its suite of libraries includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- tokenization, stemming, and tagging\n",
      "- chunking and parsing\n",
      "- language modeling\n",
      "- classification and clustering\n",
      "- logical semantics\n",
      "\n",
      "NLTK is a useful pedagogical resource for learning NLP with Python and serves as a starting place for producing production grade code that requires natural language analysis. It is also important to understand what NLTK is _not_:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Production ready out of the box\n",
      "- Lightweight\n",
      "- Generally applicable\n",
      "- Magic\n",
      "\n",
      "NLTK provides a variety of tools that can be used to explore the linguistic domain but is not a lightweight dependency that can be easily included in other workflows, especially those that require unit and integration testing or other build processes. This stems from the fact that NLTK includes a lot of added code but also a rich and complete library of corpora that power the built-in algorithms. \n",

NLTK provides many corpora for you to work with for exploration, but you must become able to design and construct your own corpora, and to implement `nltk.CorpusReader` objects - classes that in a memory safe and efficient way are able to read entire corpora and analyze them. \n",

However, this methodology leaves you at the mercy of the tagging model that you have provided, and does not allow you to make corrections that are saved in between runs. Instead you should preprocess your text to allow it to be read by the `nltk.corpus.TaggedCorpusReader` or the penultimate corpus, the `nltk.corpus.BracketParseCorpusReader`. \n",

      "\n",
      "You should then write a program that uses an NLTK parser and the grammar you constructed that will return a syntactic tree if the input is a noun phrase or None if the input is ungrammatical. Your program will have to take the input sentence, tokenize it and then tag it according to the lexicon (you can assume that words in this lexicon do not have multiple senses) - you'll then have to pass the grammar phrase (the tags) to the parser.\n",

      "Create test and training sets from the data then build both a NaiveBayes and Maxent classifier - make sure that you save these classifiers to disk using the `pickle` module! The Maxent classifier in particular will take a long time to train. Once they're trained; report the accuracy of each as well as the most informative features. Are there any surprises? Which classifier performs better?\n"
